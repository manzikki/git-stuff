EADME for the Gnu Image Finding Tools (GIFT) used in CDS-Invenio for image based retrieval 

Last modified on 18, aout 2010 by Xin Zhou

This file describes the integration of GIFT in Invenio.

1. Installation of GIFT : apt-get install gnuift (so far only OS with apt system is addressed.)
2. Enable image ranking method :
	-	Login in Invenio as admin
	-	Goto "Administration"->"bibrank configuration"
	-	Available ranking methods are listed. To enable the "image_similarity",
		click "Add new rank method" and select "image_similarity" as template.
		And then select dedicated collections.
	-	Run "bibrank -R" and check whether GIFT is doing feature extraction and indexation.
3. Enable the interface :
	-	Goto "Administration"->"bibFormat configuration"->"Manage Output Formats"
	-	Click "HTML brief" to check whether "Picture HTML brief" is used for the collection.
		If not, using "Add New Rule" to link "Picture HTML brief" to the collection by 
		specifying the symbolic field name. 
	-	Click "HTML detailed" to check whether "Picture HTML detailed" is used for the collection.
		If not, using "Add New Rule" to link "Picture HTML detailed" to the collection by 
		specifying the symbolic field name. 
	-	CFG_BIBRANK_ALLOW_GIFT in config.py must be turned on to be 1.
4. Restart apache to make everything renewed by.


To disable the GIFT is even simpler:

	-	Remove the "image similarity" rank method will stop index the image collection.
	-	Disable the CFG_BIBRANK_ALLOW_GIFT to be 0 will hide the interface.
