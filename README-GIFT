EADME for the Gnu Image Finding Tools (GIFT) used in CDS-Invenio for image based retrieval 

Last modified on 18, aout 2010 by Xin Zhou

This file describes the integration of GIFT in Invenio.

1. Installation of GIFT : apt-get install gnuift (so far only OS with apt system is addressed.)
2. Enable image ranking method :
	-	Login in Invenio as admin
	-	Goto "Administration"->"bibrank configuration"
	    Available ranking methods are listed. To enable the "image_similarity",
		click "Add new rank method" and select "image_similarity" as template.
		Then select dedicated collections.
	-	In "BibRank Admin Interface", click on "show details".
		Check the parameters in "Configuration file" part. 
		All parameters are mainly for identifying image urls in the collection.
		Four parameters are set by 4 variables:		
        + icon_obj : 		the xml tag for the image object, by default '8564_'
        + icon_label_tag :	the xml tag which indicates the nature of object, 
        				  	usually is 'x'
        + icon_label_value: the image label value, by default 'icon'
          					(as GIFT normalize all images into 256x256, 
          					take icon image is enough for similarity comparison)
        + icon_url_tag : 	the xml tag for the image url, by default is 'q'
        These parameters need to be correctly set to ensure the functionality of 
        "image similarity" rank method.
        ( For example, the default set means: 
          - for each record, if 8564_x equals to 'icon' then pick the value in 
        	8564_q as image url. 
          Therefore, if in practice 8564_q is not a image url or 8564_x is not 
          equals to 'icon', please change these parameters by clicking "Modify", 
          put the correct values, then restart apache and run "webcoll -f".
        )
    -	Goto "Administration"->"bibindex configuration"->"Manage logical fields"
    	Check if the icon_label and icon_url fields exist (By default 8564_x and
    	8564_q). If not, add them to any index. The goal is to ensure that fields 
    	required by "image_similartiy" will be indexed by Invenio.
    -   If in the last step, no change is needed, then this step can be skipped.
    	Otherwise, run "bibindex -R" to redo the Invenio indexation.
	-	Run "bibrank -R" and check whether GIFT is doing feature extraction and 
		indexation. (Run bibrank without -R will only index new or modified records
		which contain images).
	-   To check if "image_similarity" rank method worked correctly, check 
		cds-invenio/var/gift-index-data to see whether fts files are correctly 
		stored, and "InvertedFile.db" and "url2fts.xml" are correctly generated
		(size is not equal to 0)
3. Enable the interface :
	-	Goto "Administration"->"bibFormat configuration"->"Manage Output Formats"
	-	Click "HTML brief" to check whether "Picture HTML brief" is used for the collection.
		If not, using "Add New Rule" to link "Picture HTML brief" to the collection by 
		specifying the symbolic field name. 
	-	Click "HTML detailed" to check whether "Picture HTML detailed" is used for the collection.
		If not, using "Add New Rule" to link "Picture HTML detailed" to the collection by 
		specifying the symbolic field name. 
	-	CFG_BIBRANK_ALLOW_GIFT in config.py must be turned on to be 1.
	-	Apply the changes by using "bibreformat -a", and then run restart apache,


To disable the GIFT is even simpler:

	-	Remove the "image similarity" rank method will stop index the image collection.
	-	Disable the CFG_BIBRANK_ALLOW_GIFT to be 0 will hide the interface.
